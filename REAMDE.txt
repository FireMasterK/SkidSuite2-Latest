Question: What does each program do?

Skidfuscator:
	- An obfuscator that can do the following:
		- Shrinking/Optimization:
			- Remove debug info
			- Remove unused classes
		- Obfucation
			- Rename classes/fields/methods/locals
			- Insert decompiler-breaking code
			- Obfuscate strings
SkidVisualizer:
	- A code analysis and decompiler tool.
	- Drag a jar onto the side panel and click a file to decompile.
		- Right click on refrences in the decompiled source 
		  (ASM view only) for option
			- View parents/interfaces/children of class
			- Show stack simulation
			- Show class relations (WIP)
			- Find references to objects
	- Decompile classes with Procyon
MappingUtil:
	- Has three main functions:
	- Correlation
		- Given a target and clean jar + before/after names of class 
		  files the target jar will have its classes/fields/methods 
		  renamed automatically. The process requires the class files 
		  are the exact same (structure wise. Names do not matter). 
		  Only one file similarity is needed. The rest are automated 
		  if future possible class matches are determined to be 
		  the same.
		- The final mappings are applied and saved as Enigma mappings
	- Processing:
		- Given a path to a jar file and mappings, will apply the
		  mappings to the jar and export a jar with updated 
		  class/field/method names.
	- Conversion:
		- Given a mapping file, can convert mappings between multiple 
		  formats.
		- Currently supported: Proguard, SRG, Enigma
ObfuRemover:
	- Removes DashO, ZKM5, and some older Stringer string encryption 
	  techniques.
	- Requires -noverify to run
Scanner:
	- Scans for jars in the same directory (or sub-directories) 
	  and when clicked will scan and show where malicious intent 
	  can be found. It's not a gurentee just a possibility.

Question: Help, something's not working!

Everything requires Java 8 to run. If you do not have Java 8 installed
install it and uninstall outdated versions. 

For more information on "oh no it broken!!1", run the jar file through 
command line. For windows you can make a batch file with the following 
command:
	java -jar JAR_NAME.jar
	pause
Save and run the batch file. The error that causes the program not to
work will most likey be put in console. If it's related to a 
VerifyError edit the batch file so that it looks like this:
	java -jar -noverify JAR_NAME.jar
Run the batch file and if the program crashes again send me the crash 
and provide any resouces you were using that caused the crash. 
Attempts that I cannot fix unless this info is provided and is not 
given with the crash log will be IGNORED.

For Mac/Unix systems I believe you make a SH file. You execute jars 
the same way but the 'pause' command will not be valid. You may not 
even need it on unix systems.

Question: I have an idea that I'd like to add to SkidSuite!

Go to the Github page and open an issue and detail your idea. 
If it's useful I'll try to implement it.
